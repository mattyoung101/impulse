## Features I'd like to support
- Each oscillator has a controllable volume
    - Either as an actual integer divider (complex), shift right operator (only supports powers of two)
    - Or better yet just integrate volume as part of synthesis (i.e. noise would output between -volume and +volume
    instead of -32768 and 32767)

## In the far future
- Stereo output and stereo mixer
- Per-oscillator delay effect
