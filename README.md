# Impulse
Impulse is a retro-inspired FPGA music synthesiser with MIDI support, written in SystemVerilog. Think of it as
the NES, SNES and Sega Genesis all combined together in one super awesome package.

Impulse is simulated, synthesized and iterated on using entirely open source tools: Icarus Verilog, Yosys, Nextpnr
and VSCode.

**Directory layout:**
- build: Not included in Git, but this should be generated by CMake. It will contain all the testbench and eventually
Yosys build files.
- concept: Python code to test the overall concept of the synth (oscillators, mixing, etc).
- docs: Contains documentation about the chip architecture.
- rtl: SystemVerilog RTL code. The main source of the Impulse.
- synth: Yosys/Nextpnr synthesis scripts and data
    - ecp5: Synthesis scripts and files for Lattice ECP5 using Yosys/Nextpnr.
    - logicgates: Demo synthesis target for testing in netlistsvg
- testbench: Scripts and SystemVerilog files that define testbenches for each module

## Simulation
### Setting up the simulation toolchain
These notes assume you are running an Ubuntu derivative, because I run Linux Mint. However, instructions should
be relatively portable across Linuxes. YMMV on Mac or Windows.

Also, in the future this environment will be built as some type of Docker container along with the Yosys suite,
for easy setup, but I haven't gotten around to that yet.

- Install Icarus Verilog. In order to support SystemVerilog, you must compile Icarus from source code (the version
Ubuntu ships is too old to support `always_ff`, for example).
    - Clone the [Icarus Verilog repo](https://github.com/steveicarus/iverilog) and enter it
    - Install dependencies: `sudo apt install bison flex gperf libreadline-dev libreadline8` and any non-prehistoric C++ compiler
    - `sh autoconf.sh`
    - _(Fish shell only, if you want Clang)_ `set -x CC clang-12; set -x CXX clang++-12`
    - `./configure`
    - `make -j32`
    - `sudo make install`
    - Further instructions can be found in the Icarus Verilog README or the [Installation Guide](https://iverilog.fandom.com/wiki/Installation_Guide#Installation_From_Source) on the Icarus Verilog wiki. The notes above come from my reading of these two resources.
- Install GTKWave: `sudo apt install gtkwave`
- Install VSCode and the following additional components:
    - [Verilog extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eirikpre.systemverilog) by Eirik Presteg√•rdshus
    - Install svls, the SystemVerilog language server: download from [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/dalance/svls) and
    make sure the extracted binary is in VSCode's $PATH. I just moved it to /usr/local/bin.
    - Then, install the [svls-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dalance.svls-vscode) extension by dalance.
    - As you might be able to tell, this is all a bit of a hack, and not ideal. I'm looking in a better setup.
- Install a recent version of CMake. I recommend using the [CMake PPA](https://apt.kitware.com/)

### Running simulations
I use CMake as the build tool. It actually works surprisingly well for this, using custom targets. Here's how you can run
the simulations:

1. `cmake -B build` to generate the build files
2. `cd build`
3. `make sim` to compile the SystemVerilog testbenches into VVP files with IVerilog, and execute these files with IVerilog's `vvp`

You can then look at the .vcd files in the build directory. They are in the FST file format, which is faster
and better than all the others according to my reading. They can be viewed in GTKWave.

If you add or remove any SystemVerilog, you will need to run CMake due to the use of globs. Otherwise, between
runs just type `make sim` in the build directory.

`make clean` will delete the VVP files. Currently VCD files are not deleted, but I'll do this in the future.

## Lattice ECP5 Synthesis
### Introduction
The main FPGA that the Impulse can be synthesized for is the Lattice ECP5. Specifically, we will either
target the [OrangeCrab](https://groupgets.com/manufacturers/good-stuff-department/products/orangecrab) or
the [ULX3S](https://www.crowdsupply.com/radiona/ulx3s) (probably the latter because of its built-in audio
jack). Eventually, we will also target synthesis on our custom PCB, but that is for the future.

I use the Yosys suite, including nextpnr, as the synthesis tool. In the future, I may also look into
Verilog to Routing and compare these two tools' performance.

## Synthesizing for ASIC
Right now we do not have the financial resources to target ASIC production (both in terms of EDA tools and actually
getting on a shuttle), and it is unlikely that this design would be good enough to fab anyway.

That being said, if time and motivation permit, I will look into OpenLane and the Skywater open source PDK
to see if I can produce a design that could in theory be fabbed, just for fun :P

## Licence
Currently being decided. Either proprietary or MPL 2.0. We'll see.
